# sailsSimpleAuth

In future updates this sails application will include an authentication based on
passport.js. The idea is to use this backend with an emberjs frontend and connect
the authentication.

The goal of this repo is to help to understand how authentication can be handled
in the backend and let the login and registration tasks to the frontend.
